    Vikings[a] is the modern name given to seafaring Norse pirates from southern Scandinavia (present-day Denmark, Norway and Sweden)[3][4][5] who from the late 8th to the late 11th centuries raided, pirated, traded and settled throughout parts of Europe.[6][7][8] They also voyaged as far as the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, and North America. In some of the countries they raided and settled in, this period is popularly known as the Viking Age, and the term "Viking" also commonly includes the inhabitants of the Norse homelands as a collective whole. The Vikings had a profound impact on the Early medieval history of Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, Estonia, and Kievan Rus'.[9]
